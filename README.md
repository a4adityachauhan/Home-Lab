# Home Lab
This repository holds the documentation for my home lab I've built up and guides for others wanting
to build their own home network. Building your own home network is the best way to learn and can be
much cheaper than you think.


### Network Diagram
This is my current network configuration.  I used Visio to create the diagram.

### My Hardware
Below is the hardware I use to run my home network.  My network works great for my needs, 
but by no means could support several users.  Building a network for enterprise use is a different beast.
Define what you need and want from your home lab before even thinking about buying hardware. Do lots of research. Many hardware buying guides from bloggers and streamers spend way too much money.  For example, if you are only going to store
files and host your own website, it makes no sense to spend $3,000 on a server with 52 GB of RAM. 
It's tempting to buy the latest and greatest hardware.  Always: 1.Ready  2.Aim  3.Fire

# Community
This is a really great community for seeing what others do.  Great resource for building your
own homelab.  Although, most everyone in this subreddit overspends on equipment. <br />
